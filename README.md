# HealthCareSolution

<h3> About HealthCareSolution </h3>

A project made in 4 hours for a college contest on theme "HEALTH" . The main purpose of this project is to make aware of its users about all kinds of diseases and provide them symptoms along with medicines , also any user can book an appointment with any of the doctor , if available .

This software is both for user and doctors doctor can check what appointments have been booked for them and so they can attend the meeting in person or via call.

We also made this app secure by adding RSA encryption so that users cannot logon to as a doctor or other persons .

This software also provides rights to doctor such as to add disease if in case it is not already present in the software so it is up to date.

And finally , this software will also make a graph based on your previous health conditions and provide you with beneficial information and since in today life people like challenges and competitions so much so we also added a leader board where people can check top 3 users and there points based on their health.

<h3> Thats all , hope you like it! </h3>

# NOTE : 
This project was made in a rush , so it maybe hard to contribute or fully understand the source code . So , if you got some ideas better drop them in issues I will surely check them and will try my best to apply them .
